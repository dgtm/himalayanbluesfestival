Long Tall Deb’s new full-length studio recording “Raise Your Hands” was released through VizzTone Label Group March 5, 2013.“Raise Your Hands” evolved from a series of impromptu writing sessions, affectionately referred to as the Wednesday Night Music Club (so as not to infringe on Sheryl Crow’s Tuesday Night version), that began in the fall of 2011. Landolt, organist John Popovich and bassist Melvin Powe would gather with new song ideas and jam on themes and variations. Often in between his international tour dates, Columbus stalwart Sean Carney would join the fun. 2013 will find Long Tall Deb out promoting “Raise Your Hands” while partnering with longtime friend and collaborator, Colin John at clubs and festivals.
</p>
<p>
Colin John “The Transpacific Bluesman” is internationally regarded as a unique musician, possessing world -class skills on acoustic, resonator, and electric guitars.
Demonstrating  formidable fingerpicking skills and commanding slide playing,both in lap and bottleneck styles, Colin commands the stage with his synthesis of blues, soul, rock and Hawaiian guitar.
As  CD Baby wrote,"Colin seems like the embodiment of the love child of Charlie Patton, Jimi Hendrix, John Lee Hooker, Muddy Waters, Jimmy Page, and Stevie Ray Vaughan.But then, throw that love child into island life and raise him with the rich tradition of Hawaiian lap steel guitar, and you just might wind up with someone like Colin John.

										<h2 class="festival-headers">French Cowboy and The One</h2>
									</header>
<p>
<center><img src="images/frenchcowboy.png" alt="" class="artistimage"></center>
French Cowboy is like a good pizza : no matter the topping - and there's a fair choice of them , it's good. It all began in 1991 with The Little Rabbits, a milestone of French indie rock. Fifteen years and six albums later, the band split to regroup around Federico Pellegrini's (the leader / songwriter) new project: French Cowboy, and their own label : Havalina records. Between 2007 and 2010, they released three albums under the name French Cowboy, listed below. French Cowboy & The One started as another live version of French Cowboy. It's a duet (Federico Pellegrini and drummer Éric Pifeteau) playing some sort of garage disco punk, with a lot of fuzz guitars, drums, loops, claps, delays and voices stacked on one another. One of the best description of what french Cowboy & The One is on stage comes from French intensity explodes with two members.French Cowboy now uses a Gibson SG to make the distortions scream. A fat sound, crazy rythmics by The One, ranges in variety of music including swing, rock'n'roll, techno or other drum'n'bass follies, and pop.

<p>
<center><img src="images/prova2.JPG" alt="" class="artistimage"></center>
Mr. No Money Band was officially formed in Bologna in 2005. Starting from the interpretation of standards of Blues and Rock & Roll, the band has merged elements of tradition into original compositions. Over the years the Band obtained many acknowledgments, has been regular at Italian summer Festivals, and started different collaborations with leading musicians. The many concerts (over 600) and musical collaborations with the Italian and international musicians who played with us, have given this band a unique sound! In 2012 the Band launched its first Album "Money and Fear ... never had", which involved some of the most famous Italian Bluesmen. The Album has been presented during a summer tour of more than 40 concerts on the most important stages of southern Italy. After the success of the album Mr. No Money Band is preparing the Tour between India and Nepal by presenting their latest unreleased song " Moustache Woman". With its disco/funk sound, this song is the result of the Band's passion and musical research, trying to melt Blues, Country, Bluegrass and Rock & Roll.

										<h2 class="festival-headers">Robin & The New Revolution</h2>
									</header>
<p>
<center><img src="images/robin.jpg" alt=""></center><br>
In a predominantly stagnant Nepali music industry where most bands don’t play their instruments and everything sounds and looks manufactured, Robin N Looza stuck out like a sore thumb. The band’s debut was a revelation and spawned a number of clones. Their live shows were energetic thanks to an exceptionally tight rhythm section and a charismatic front man, and their anthemic songs took them from strength to strength. However, as great as a band may be, there always comes a time when one gets bored of doing the same thing for years and looks to branch out. And that’s exactly what the front man Robin did.With a desire of playing different styles of music, and with a couple of songs already under his belt, Robin recruited several members for a project entitled Robin & The New Revolution. The new members were definitely not new to the music scene though. Rajesh, the drummer, also played in the backup band for the Angels, bassist Prabin was an accomplished studio musician and Dipesh, who still plays the lead guitar, is an arranger. And unlike in the past, Robin was seen playing the rhythm on his sunburst Fender. Kta/Kt the debut album of “Robin and the New Revolution” was a huge hit and the band grabbed some prestigious awards aswell. More than awards, Kta/Kt brought about a change. Following up Kta/Kt, the band produced another acclaimed album – 13000, which was dedicated to the people who lost their lives during the political insurgency in the country.<br>
With two new changes in their line ups, Sonam Lama replacing Prabin on Bass and Sanam Shrestha replacing Rajesh on the drums, the band still continues to enthrall and amaze its crowd with the music of their own. A steady groove of funk, blues, slow rock and folk tunes with a blend of down to earth words elevating patriotism – this what Robin and The New Revolution is all about
