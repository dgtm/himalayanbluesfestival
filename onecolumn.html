The HIMALAYAN BLUES FESTIVAL is a Nepali originated artistic-cultural event, whose objective is to promote Blues music developed in the United States and to integrate it with the roots and the folklore of our country, as well as to offer a different alternative from those that are generally presented on festivals and artistic-cultural activities in Nepal. It promotes various other genres which are the ramifications of Blues together with Folk and Ethnic music. The Himalayan Blues Festival 2010 was also expanded to Mumbai, Bangalore and Delhi. The main aim is to promote Himalayan Blues as an Asian Music Festival travelling it to as many nations as possible in future years.
